  Experienced in both industry and academia, I bring a versatile background in GPU software development and research. I specialize in optimizing and advancing AI and graphics technologies. With expertise in Py Torch, C++, Python, and graphics APIs such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX, I am dedicated to pushing the limits of AI-accelerator/GPU integration.
  Prior to this, as a Research Assistant at CURIN, Chitkara University, I developed Unity, OpenGL, and Vulkan applications for advanced trigonometry and linear algebra projects, alongside creating AR/VR tools for educational enhancement.
  My research journey includes publishing eight papers in SCI Journals and IEEE, spanning topics such as advanced video analysis using Video Vision Transformers (Intel DTTC 2024), AR applications for enhancing spatial skills in trigonometry (Hyperspace AR, Springer US), and interactive tools for visualizing linear algebra concepts (AR for Linear Algebra Visualization, IEEE).
  Further, I've filed three patents in AR/VR technology and secured over INR 10 Lakhs in grants for prototyping innovative applications. Awards include winning the BRIC Technology Exposition 2020 and the Novate+ NewGen IEDC Grant from the Government of India. I've also delivered lectures internationally, including 'Computational Models with LLM' and 'Mathematical Visualization for Learning' at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Malaysia.
  Passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation, I excel in bridging research insights with practical applications, aiming to push the boundaries of AI, graphics, and educational tools.
